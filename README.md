# Neural Network Simulation
Online visualisation of a neural network, designed for classroom teaching.
This was my NEA for my A levels.


This was mostly made with JavaScript, including the forward and back propogation, but in future I might use Python for the maths instead. The main purpose of this simulation is to make it easier to leran and understand how neural networks work at a basic level, so that e.g. secondary school teachers can teach their students how they run.

For the scale of the project, please see the code in the latest iteration (as of 09/01/2026, this is iteration 4, found in public/iter_4).

All the relevant code can be found within the iteration folder at functions/funcs.js and in script.js.
This contains 40 functions (38 in funcs.js, 2 in script.js).
