# Neural Network Simulation
Online visualisation of a neural network, designed for classroom teaching.
This was my NEA for my A levels.


This was mostly made with JavaScript, including the forward and back propogation, but in future I might use Python for the maths instead. The main purpose of this simulation is to make it easier to leran and understand how neural networks work at a basic level, so that e.g. secondary school teachers can teach their students how they run.
